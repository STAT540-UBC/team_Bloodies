# This folder stores the DNA methylation results.
We conducted DNA methylation of the bisulfite-sequencing data by RnBeads. The annotation for data input with donor and technical information is [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/RnBeads_input_annotation).  
Quality check and data exploration: please refer to [coverage summary](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/Coverage%20summary), [filtering](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/Filtering) [variance and distribution](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/Variance%26Distribution)  
[PCA](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/PCA) analysis of a pair of populations showing separation based on cell type. The [PCA](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/PCA/All%20sample%20PCA) result generated from the **whole run with all 6 cell types** showed that PC1,PC2,PC3 were not strongly related to cell type.  
[Clustering](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/Clustering) heatmaps showed same cell types cluster together based on methylation status on promoter and enhancers.  
Through differential methylation analysis using Limma, differentialy methylated [promoters and enhancers](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/1.DNA_methylation_RnBeads/Differential_meth_regions_filtered) were identified.
