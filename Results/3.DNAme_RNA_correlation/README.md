We tested whether DNA methylation was correlated with gene expression levels using the lists of genes with [low methylated promoters](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/3.DNAme_RNA_correlation/Genelist_low_methylation) and [high expression](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/tree/master/Results/3.DNAme_RNA_correlation/Genelist_normal_high_expression). However, the [result](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/blob/master/Results/3.DNAme_RNA_correlation/Overlap_Methylation_vs_RNA.pdf) did not show a clear correlation or enrichment of highly expressed genes in genes with lower methylation.
