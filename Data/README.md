# Data

We work with two types of data--DNA methylation (bisulfite-seq) and RNA-seq data from published BluePrint Epigenome repertoire. Both DNA and RNA were collected from primary human peripheral blood cells with seven stem/progenitor populations with distinct immunophenotypes:  
HSC: Lin- CD34+ CD38- CD90+ CD45RA- CD49f+;  
MPP: Lin- CD34+ CD38- CD90- CD45RA- CD49f-;  
CMP: Lin- CD34+ CD38+ CD45RA-CD123 low;  
MEP: Lin- CD34+ CD38+ CD45RA- CD123- FLT3- CD36- CD110+ CD41-;  
GMP: Lin- CD34+ CD38+ CD45RA+ CD123+ CD10-;  
CLP: Lin- CD34+ CD38+ CD45RA+ CD7- CD10+;  
MLP1: Lin- CD34+ CD38- CD90- CD45RA+ CD7- CD10+.

For more detailed description of data types and processing, go to [Data Summary and Processing Details](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_Bloodies/blob/master/Data/Data_Summary_and_Processing_Details.md). The RNA-seq data is processed with differential expression analysis across all populations. The DNA methylation data is too big to upload and the GEO ID has been provided for each.
