Listing my preprocessing and analysis steps.
The overall idea is to compare the expression of relevant transcription factors (TFs) in leukaemia to normal samples, and to then analyse the entire genome to compare the availability of their binding sites. It would be expected that when a TF is upregulated, this is concurrent with its binding sites being more available; but TF binding sites are highly redundant and very frequent in the genome.
The first step will be to analyse RNA-seq data for upregulation (compared to what?) of TFs, and cross-reference these back to the data for hematopoeitic cell differentiation.
The second step will be to analyse DNA methylation data to see whether TF binding sites (based on some consensus sequence from the literature) have been made more accessible, based on reduced methylation in this area.

3.TF binding site enrichment analysis to find potential TF associated with differentiation cell types: map the TF binding motif to the regulatory regions of upregulated genes from step 3 (Homer v4.8 findMotifsGenome.pl tool); generate a list of “active” TFs for population pairs; statistical analyses indicating the enrichment analysis makes sense and does not happen by chance.

a) Take list of upregulated genes specifically for each population
b) For promoter regions of these genes (define - how many kB up/downstream of TSS? back up with papers?) identify which known TF motifs are enriched
c) List the TFs associated with these motifs
d) Perform T tests to identify how likely it would be for these results to occur by chance

- What does "population pairs" mean? 
- What metrics exactly are we putting into the T tests in d?
